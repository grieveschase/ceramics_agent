Classification Concepts

Positive Features: Positive evidence, Present features, Affirmative attributes, Inclusion features
    -These are traits that are directly observed. (positive feature activations)

Negative Features: Negative evidence, Absent features, Exclusion criteria, Non-occurring attributes, Contrastive features
    -traits that are specifically not present and therefore eliminate possibilities.

The absence of features is just as informative as their presence. Sometimes more informative.
In classification theory, these are often called discriminative negatives.
They reduce hypothesis space. "hypothesis space" --> important concept.


How Humans Operate when looking at something, ie trying to classify an item, contrastive reasoning:
    1-Rapid holistic scan
    2-Activation of candidate style clusters (what does it have that matches others or puts it into a bin)
    3-Immediate pruning based on missing key markers (what is missing that removes it from that bin)
    4-Weighted comparison among remaining candidates (Weight Positive and Negative Features in each bin, seek contradictions)


Art Style portion in a Pipeline:
    
    (a) Observed Features
        - what was observed
        - positive features list
    (b) Explicitly Absent Features
        - what was not observed
        - negative features list
    
    (c) Eliminated Style Classes
        - what that rules out
    (d) Remaining Candidate Styles
        - what remains plausible
    (e) Hypotheses
        - how confident and why.

Epistemology - the theory of knowledge, especially with regard to its methods, validity, and scope.
Ontology - the branch of metaphysics dealing with the nature of being.
Posterior Probability - the revised probability of an event or hypothesis occurring after considering new evidence or data,
                         calculated using Bayes' theorem to update the prior probability.
