# Overview

- Read @requirements.txt and/or requirements.txt before writing code.
- Assume the active interpreter is the project venv (./.venv or ./venv) if it is present.
- When using any third‑party API, cite the doc page for the installed version and verify the call signature.
- Prefer using snake case for variable names.
- When asked to ‘match the output of a function’, preserve keys, dtypes, shapes, and semantics. If unknown, inspect the referenced function before coding.
- If the request is underspecified, choose the safest reasonable default and state assumptions in 1–3 bullets.
